This document grades the newly implemented and pushed work according to the Member 1 to Member 6 responsibility structure, then lists extra updates implemented beyond the original member checklist.

## Grading Scale

| Grade | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| A | Complete for project/demo scope and well integrated. |
| B | Mostly complete, with minor polish or production gaps remaining. |
| C | Partially complete, usable but missing important behavior. |
| D | Started but not reliably usable. |
| Pending | Not implemented yet. |

## Member 1 - Team Lead and Architect

Original responsibility:

- Create repository and folder structure.
- Set up frontend/backend starter.
- Connect team members' work.
- Handle deployment and make sure the full project runs properly.

Current status: **A- / Mostly Complete**

Implemented work:

- The completed implementation was pushed to the designated GitHub repository.
- Full-stack project structure is now organized into frontend, backend, parser, normalizer, ML, job, route, model, deployment, and sample sections.
- Docker deployment files were added:
  - `Dockerfile.server`
  - `Dockerfile.client`
  - `docker-compose.yml`
  - `deploy/nginx.conf`
- GitLab CI pipeline was added:

  - Parser smoke testing.
  - Frontend build.
  - Docker packaging.
- Deployment guide was added:
  - `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Job pipeline documentation was added:
  - `server/JOB_PIPELINE.md`
- `.dockerignore` and `.gitignore` were improved to avoid committing generated/runtime files.

Why not full A+:

- Hosted production deployment is prepared but not actually hosted on a live public server.
- GitLab pipeline file is prepared, but the project was pushed to GitHub; GitLab execution depends on using a GitLab remote/project.

Final assessment:

Member 1 work is complete for project submission and local/demo deployment. Public cloud deployment remains the only production-level extension.

## Member 2 - Parser Engineer

Original responsibility:

- Build Python parser for `.evtx` and `.pcap`.
- Convert them into usable JSON data.
- Create `/parse` API.
- Generate SHA-256 file hashes.

Current status: **A / Complete**

Implemented work:

  - `server/python_parsers/parse_artifact.py`
- `.evtx` parsing implemented.
- `.pcap` parsing implemented.
- Dedicated Node wrapper added:
  - `server/parsers/pythonArtifactParser.js`
- Dedicated parser files added for:
  - System logs.

- Fresh parser smoke samples were tested through the live API:
  - Linux system log.
  - Windows-style event log text.
  - Metadata CSV.
  - Registry `.reg`.
  - Metadata JSON.
  - Synthetic `.pcap`.
  - Real Windows `.evtx`.

Verification:

The parser smoke test passed for 7 generated artifacts through `/api/parse`, verifying SHA-256, parser selection, normalizer selection, event counts, risk scoring, MITRE fields, and ML annotations.

Final assessment:

Member 2 work is fully complete for the required project scope.

## Member 3 - Detection Engineer

Original responsibility:

- Build attack detection rules and correlation engine using MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
- Turn raw events into meaningful attack alerts like brute force or PowerShell attacks.

Current status: **A / Complete**

Implemented work:

- MITRE ATT&CK mapping integrated into event enrichment.
- Risk scoring engine added:
  - `server/analysis/riskScoring.js`
- Correlation engine added:

  - Data transfer after script execution.
- Timeline API updated to include correlated attack alerts.
- Timeline frontend updated to display attack alert cards.
- Case detail page updated to show correlated timeline/detection results.
- Reports now include a dedicated correlated attack alerts section.

Final assessment:

Member 3 work is complete for the required project scope. It can be expanded later with more rules, but the expected detection engine is implemented and integrated.

## Member 4 - ML Engineer

Original responsibility:

- Build anomaly detection system using Isolation Forest machine learning.
- Find suspicious behavior patterns normal rules may miss.

Current status: **A / Complete**

Implemented work:

- Isolation Forest anomaly detector added using Python/scikit-learn:
  - `server/ml/anomaly_detector.py`
- Node wrapper added:
  - `server/ml/anomalyDetector.js`
- ML requirements added:
  - `server/ml/requirements.txt`
- ML anomaly detection integrated into:
  - Evidence processing worker.
  - Direct `/api/parse` endpoint.
  - Report generation.
  - Anomaly dashboard API.
- `/api/anomalies` endpoint added:
  - `server/routes/anomalies.js`
- ML anomaly data added to Evidence model.
- Report generation now includes an ML Anomaly Detection section.
- Frontend Anomaly Dashboard added:
  - `client/src/pages/AnomalyDashboard.jsx`

Verified behavior:

The anomaly endpoint returned completed Isolation Forest output for the demo case:

- 20 events scanned.
- 4 ML anomalies detected.
- 8 correlated attack alerts available alongside anomaly results.

Important correction:

- The model detects outliers inside the current event set.
- It does not yet compare against a stored historical baseline such as a previous day, week, or month of normal activity.

Final assessment:

Member 4 work is fully implemented and integrated with backend, frontend, and reporting.

## Member 5 - Frontend Engineer

Original responsibility:

- Create website UI including upload page, attack timeline, anomaly dashboard, and report download button.
- Make the project look professional and easy to use.

- Sidebar updated with Anomaly Dashboard navigation.
- Case detail page updated with enhanced evidence/timeline/report workflow behavior.
- API helper updated for parse, job, anomaly, and timeline features.
- Reports UI remains connected to generated reports and PDF export flow.

Why not full A+:

- The UI is functional and demo-ready, but automated frontend UI tests and extra visual polish are still possible future improvements.

Final assessment:

Member 5 work is complete for project submission and demonstration.

## Member 6 - Report and Integration Engineer

Original responsibility:

- Connect all modules together.
- Create final forensic PDF report.
- Build full upload -> analysis -> report generation pipeline.

Current status: **A- / Mostly Complete**

Implemented work:

- Full pipeline integrated:
  - Upload.
  - SHA-256 hashing.
  - AES-256-GCM secure storage.
  - BullMQ job queue.
  - Controlled parser access.
  - Parsing.
  - Normalization.
  - MITRE mapping.
  - IOC enrichment.
  - Risk scoring.
  - Correlation alerts.
  - ML anomaly detection.
  - Timeline reconstruction.
  - Report generation.
  - PDF export.
- Report model updated with export metadata and hash.
- Report generation updated with sections:

  - Correlated Attack Alerts.
  - ML Anomaly Detection.
  - Threat Indicators.
  - MITRE ATT&CK.
  - Recommendations.
- Legal-context sample report added.
- Corporate-context sample report added.

Important corrections:

- Backend PDF export hashing exists, but the report detail frontend still has a browser print-window export path that can bypass the backend hash/export metadata route.
- Legal and corporate sample reports exist, and prompts use neutral forensic wording, but the app does not yet provide selectable legal/corporate report profiles or separate report rulesets.

Final assessment:

Member 6 work is complete for the main upload-to-report workflow, but final report security and legal/corporate positioning still need frontend/profile refinement for a stricter production interpretation.

### Reporting Improvements

- Reports now include deterministic detection results, not only AI-written sections.
- Reports include ML anomaly findings.
- Reports include correlated attack alerts.
- Backend PDF export metadata and hash support added.
- Frontend report detail export still needs to call the backend export route to guarantee final product hash metadata is recorded.
- Legal and corporate sample reports added for presentation context.
- Selectable legal/corporate report profiles are not implemented yet.

### Frontend Improvements

- Dedicated anomaly dashboard added.
- Timeline alert cards added.
- Sidebar navigation updated.

## Final Project Evaluation

The current project is complete for academic submission and project expo demonstration. It now shows a professional end-to-end forensic workflow:

Case Management -> Evidence Upload -> Hashing -> Secure Storage -> Job Queue -> Parsing -> Normalization -> MITRE Mapping -> Risk Scoring -> Correlation -> ML Anomaly Detection -> Timeline -> Dashboard -> Report Generation -> Backend PDF Export

The remaining improvements are production-level extensions such as public cloud hosting, more forensic artifact formats, larger rule libraries, automated UI tests, formal key rotation/envelope encryption, stored historical anomaly baselines, selectable report profiles, and frontend wiring to the backend hashed PDF export route.
